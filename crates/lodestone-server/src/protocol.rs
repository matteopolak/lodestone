//! The protocol seam between the version-free integrated server and a
//! version-specific packet format.
//!
//! [`ServerProtocol`] is the mirror of the client's `VersionAdapter`: it is the
//! **only** point where wire ids, encodings, NBT and registries enter the
//! server. A version/protocol crate implements it; this crate never names a
//! protocol number. Keeping the coupling behind one trait is what lets the
//! integrated-server loop stay shared while each version supplies its own
//! encoders/decoders (plan §3).
