//! Terrain source for the integrated server.
//!
//! A [`ChunkSource`] answers "what blocks are in column `(cx, cz)`?".
//!
//! Two implementations ship, and the distinction matters:
//!
//! * [`OverworldChunkSource`] is the **real** pipeline. It wraps
//!   [`lodestone_worldgen::overworld::OverworldGenerator`] — the composed,
//!   JVM-verified generator (interpolated `final_density` shape + sea-level
//!   aquifer + surface rules) — so its columns carry actual vanilla block-state
//!   strings (grass, dirt, stone, gravel, water, …), not a solid/air mask. This
//!   is the source a real client should be served, and the one the shell renders.
//! * [`WorldgenChunkSource`] is a **solidity-only** source kept for the
//!   transport/seam tests. It point-samples a bare [`Density`] node per block and
//!   maps `> 0` to stone — no cell interpolation, no surface, no fluid. It exists
//!   because the in-memory-transport tests only need *a* deterministic terrain to
//!   prove the wire round-trip, not a vanilla-accurate one. Do not reach for it
//!   as "the generator"; that is what [`OverworldChunkSource`] is.
//!
//! # The column carries block states, not just solidity
//!
//! [`ChunkColumn`] stores a per-column palette of block-state strings plus a
//! dense index grid (the same representation [`GeneratedColumn`] uses), so a
//! `ServerProtocol::encode_chunk` can emit a real chunk. The historical
//! solid/air API ([`ChunkColumn::set_solid`]/[`ChunkColumn::is_solid`]) is
//! preserved as a view over that field: a block is "solid" when it is neither air
//! nor a fluid, and `set_solid(true)` writes canonical stone.
//!
//! # Edits need somewhere to live
//!
//! [`ChunkSource::set_block`] mutates a block in place and [`ChunkSource::column`]
//! must go on reflecting that mutation afterward — that only works if *something*
//! retains the edited column, and before this existed, nothing did:
//! `OverworldChunkSource::column` called straight through to the generator on
//! every request. See [`OverworldChunkSource`]'s own doc comment for the
//! retention this module now adds and why it is scoped to edited columns only,
//! not every column ever requested.
