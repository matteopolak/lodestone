//! Server-side mob simulation — the *consumer* that ticks mob AI.
//!
//! `lodestone-entity` owns a complete goal scheduler, A\* pathfinder, and the
//! [`NavigatingMob`] composition that wires them together over the version-free
//! [`PathWorld`] seam. Until now nothing in a *running* world ticked any of it:
//! in vanilla multiplayer the client interpolates server-streamed positions and
//! correctly runs no AI, so the natural home for mob AI is the **server**, and
//! the server had no tick loop for it. This module is that home.
//!
//! Two pieces, deliberately kept separate rather than fused:
//!
//! * [`ChunkWorld`] adapts the server's own solid/air [`ChunkColumn`] terrain
//!   into a [`PathWorld`]. It is the exact analogue of `lodestone-render`'s
//!   `world.rs`: this crate owns terrain *storage*, `lodestone-entity` owns the
//!   traversal reasoning, and the adapter is the single seam between them. It is
//!   version-free by construction — it only ever asks a block "are you solid?",
//!   never "what block-state id are you?", so no registry knowledge leaks in.
//!   (A version crate that maps real block-state ids to `PathType`/collision —
//!   water malus, fence tops at 1.5 — is a separate, higher-fidelity adapter; it
//!   belongs there, not in this version-free crate.)
//! * [`MobSim`] owns the live mobs and advances them one tick at a time. The
//!   world outlives the sim (the mobs borrow it), which is why `ChunkWorld` is a
//!   value the caller holds and hands to [`MobSim::new`] by reference.
//!
//! # Scope, honestly
//!
//! This ticks AI over terrain. It does **not** stream the resulting positions to
//! a connected client: that needs a version crate's client-bound `add_entity` /
//! `move_entity` *encoders*, which this version-free crate may not implement
//! without naming a protocol number — the same reported encoder seam
//! `serve_connection` already documents. So this is the server-authoritative
//! simulation half; the wire half is a separate seam. Keeping them separate is
//! the point: a wrong-because-half-built loop is worse than an honest boundary.

// `#[cfg(test)]` fake proves nothing about the public seam).
