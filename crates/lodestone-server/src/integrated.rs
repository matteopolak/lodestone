//! [`IntegratedServer`] — the reachable entry point for singleplayer.
//!
//! Everything else in this crate is a *primitive*: [`serve_connection`] is an
//! `async fn` that serves exactly one connection, delivers the initial view,
//! and then keeps serving (keep-alives, movement, further acknowledgements)
//! until the client disconnects. That is the right shape for a test, but a
//! menu / shell that wants to *start singleplayer* needs a handle it can hold,
//! query for its address, and shut down cleanly without leaking a task.
//! `IntegratedServer` is that handle.
//!
//! It deliberately offers the two transports the plan (§8) calls for behind the
//! **same** [`serve_connection`] loop, which is the whole point — singleplayer
//! and open-to-LAN are the identical server, differing only in transport:
//!
//! * [`IntegratedServer::open_in_memory`] — a [`memory_pair`] duplex. The server
//!   half is served in-process; the client half is handed back for
//!   `lodestone-client`'s `connect_with`. No socket, no port, works on wasm
//!   targets that have a task spawner. This is singleplayer.
//! * [`IntegratedServer::bind`] — a real `TcpListener` (native only). Every
//!   accepted socket is served by the same loop. This is open-to-LAN, and it
//!   exists to prove the claim that LAN falls out of singleplayer for free.
//!
//! Transport choice, justified: the in-memory duplex is the default for
//! singleplayer because it needs no port, races nothing, and is the path that
//! eventually lets a browser build run singleplayer with no server at all. TCP
//! is offered alongside — not instead — because binding a loopback socket is the
//! honest way to exercise real framing end-to-end and is what "open to LAN"
//! actually is. Both run byte-for-byte the same [`serve_connection`].
//!
//! Spawning requires a task-spawning context: an entered Tokio runtime natively
//! (a shell that runs under `#[tokio::main]` already satisfies this), or the
//! browser event loop on wasm (`wasm-bindgen-futures`' `spawn_local`, selected
//! behind the [`spawn`](crate::spawn) seam). The in-memory path is thus the one
//! that lets a browser build run singleplayer with no server at all.
//!
//! [`serve_connection`]: crate::serve_connection
