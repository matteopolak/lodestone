/// # Architectural notes
///
/// 1.16 rewrote join substantially, and it is the clearest place the version
/// isolation earns its keep:
///
/// * The current dimension is no longer a numeric byte (`-1`/`0`/`1`); it is a
///   **namespaced world name string** (`world_name`, e.g. `minecraft:overworld`)
///   plus two inline **NBT** blobs — a `dimension_codec` registry and the
///   per-world `dimension` type. This crate consumes both NBT blobs (there is no
///   registry consumer yet) and maps `world_name` onto the canonical
///   `DimensionId`.
/// * `game_mode` is a plain `u8` (0..=3); hardcore is a **separate** boolean
///   (`is_hardcore`), unlike pre-1.16 where the `0x8` bit of the mode byte
///   flagged it.
///
/// The inline NBT blobs are captured as raw named-NBT byte spans; the client
/// currently only needs to carry/validate them, not interpret their contents.
